Notes: 
-I am primarily editing src/PYSimpTradConverterTable.h
-You also need fonts-hanazono to see some of the characters
-As of Dec 11, 2017 the logic is set primarily to convert SC to TC. Editing characters
must be from the TC side unless the code logic changes. Looking into it

Install: (please go to branch 1.5.x to see changed installation)
